### Introduction

This project is intended to serve as a cover page and
documentation for all personal projects. Documentation will include:
- Kanban Boards
- Project Updates
- General Random Posts


the main hope is to use this to showcase more than what's currently 
lying around on my CV and siting dormant in the repos here.
